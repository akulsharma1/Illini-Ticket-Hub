### Setup
- View `backend/readme.md` and `frontend/readme.md` in order to set up all the code
- Once set up, do `yarn start` in `backend` and `yarn start` in `frontend` in order to start both the backend and frontend.
- Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the frontend. It automatically connects to the backend.
